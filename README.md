# Final Project

On going project to create a new website for Hotel Prins Carl.

## The problem

To create a posibility to book a room I have used a script tag from the bookingsite Sirvoy that is connected to all the other sites where you can check availability and book a room. The hotel asked for a website that is easy to navigate. I have created a guestbook to add on backend to this project.

I still have a long way to go before it's done, this is just a start.

Left to do:
- Drop down to change language (I have started by using "i18next")
- Add and correct text
- Change all images and add to slide show
- Styling of image sizes
- Sign up to newsletter
- Styling of guestbook
- Add route photoalbum and create component
- Add loader
