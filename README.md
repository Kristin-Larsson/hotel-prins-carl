# Final Project

On going project to create a new website for Hotel Prins Carl.

## The problem

To create a posibility to book a room I have used a script tag from the bookingsite Sirvoy that is connected to all the other sites where you can check availability and book a room. The hotel asked for a website that is easy to navigate. I have created a guestbook to add on backend to this project.

I will continue with this project and change styling, images and add a possibility to receive newsletter.
